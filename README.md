# E-Transmission

The main objective of this project is to integrate the electrical properties of an induction motor with the engine of an automobile, such as cars. This integration offers several advantages that enhance the driving experience and overall performance of the vehicle. The primary focus is on improving ease of driving, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, noise and vibration reduction, and achieving maximum starting torque and acceleration. Importantly, this is accomplished without the use of series or parallel hybrid technology.

## **Abstract**
One of the common challenges faced by car drivers is engaging the clutch while starting to move the vehicle. Frictional clutches can be difficult to operate and engage manually, leading to inconvenience and potential driving issues. To address this problem, our project aims to develop a new kind of transmission system that incorporates an electromagnetic clutch mechanism. By leveraging the principles of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction, this innovative transmission system eliminates the need for traditional gearing.

Through this project, we will extensively study the output characteristics, including torque curves and acceleration curves, of the transmission system. The data collected from these studies will be crucial in developing a new transmission model for future cars. This technology represents a significant advancement, and implementing this transmission system will introduce a new class of automatic transmission aided vehicles that are highly fuel efficient.

## **Key Objectives**
* **Ease of driving and repair**: By eliminating the need for a clutch and gears, the integration of an induction motor simplifies the driving experience and reduces maintenance requirements.

* **Improved fuel efficiency and low-cost maintenance**: The utilization of the induction motor in the automobile engine enhances fuel efficiency, resulting in cost savings for the vehicle owner. Additionally, the reduced complexity of the transmission system contributes to lower maintenance costs.

* **Reduced noise and vibrations**: With the integration of an induction motor, noise and vibrations experienced by the driver and passengers are significantly reduced, thereby improving the overall cabin quality.

* **Maximum starting torque and acceleration**: The induction motor provides high starting torque, enabling smooth and powerful acceleration from standstill.

* **Non-hybrid technology**: Unlike traditional hybrid technologies, the induction motor integration achieves these benefits without relying on series or parallel hybrid systems.

We are excited about the potential impact of this project and the development of a new class of automatic transmission systems that enhance vehicle performance while promoting fuel efficiency.
